A script that checks to see if [Pastebin Pro](https://pastebin.com/pro) is for sale.

It used to be around atleast [early 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200531232732/https://pastebin.com/pro) but since then, it seems they have discontinued it without warning.

This script should be used along with another bot, such as a Telegram Bot or a Twitter bot, to let us know when its back for sale.
